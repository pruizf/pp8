        "reasoning_content": "We are given a poem and asked to identify the author and the century in which the author lived.\n The poem is in Spanish and appears to be a sonnet. The style and content are reminiscent of Francisco de Quevedo, a prominent Spanish writer of the Baroque period.\n\n Let's recall:\n - Francisco de Quevedo (1580-1645) was a Spanish nobleman, politician, and writer of the Baroque era.\n - He lived in the 16th and 17th centuries, but his main literary activity was in the 17th century.\n\n The poem provided is a sonnet that describes a master swordsman named Campuzano who becomes disabled and then retires to a hermitage. This is typical of Quevedo's satirical and moralizing style.\n\n We can compare with known works: This sonnet is actually one of Quevedo's famous sonnets, often titled \"A un maestro de esgrima\" or similar.\n\n Therefore:\n   author: Francisco de Quevedo\n   century: 17 (since he was born in 1580 and died in 1645, so he lived in the 17th century, though he was also alive in the late 16th)\n\n However, note that the question asks for the century in which the author lived. Since he lived during two centuries (16th and 17th), we must choose the century that is most representative of his life and work. But the instruction says \"siglo en el que vivi\u00f3\" (the century in which he lived). We can note that he was born in the 16th century and died in the 17th, so he lived in both. But typically, when we say the century of an author, we refer to the century during which they were most active. In this case, the 17th century.\n\n But to be precise, let's think: \n   - He was born in 1580 (16th century: 1501-1600)\n   - He died in 1645 (17th century: 1601-1700)\n   - He lived 65 years, 45 of which were in the 17th century (from 1601 to 1645) and 20 in the 16th (1580-1600).\n\n However, the problem does not specify how to handle authors spanning two centuries. We are to provide the century in which he lived. Since he lived in both, we might choose the 17th because that's when he produced most of his work and when he died.\n\n But note: the instruction says \"siglo en el que vivi\u00f3\", which might be interpreted as the century of his life. However, in literary contexts, authors are often associated with the century of their main activity. \n\n Alternatively, we can look for a canonical answer. This poem is by Quevedo and he is considered a 17th-century writer.\n\n Let me confirm: \n   - The poem is indeed by Francisco de Quevedo.\n\n Therefore, we set:\n   \"author\": \"Francisco de Quevedo\"\n   \"century\": \"17\"\n\n But note: his full name is Francisco G\u00f3mez de Quevedo y Villegas. However, he is commonly known as Francisco de Quevedo.\n\n The response must be in JSON format exactly as specified.\n\n Final answer:"
