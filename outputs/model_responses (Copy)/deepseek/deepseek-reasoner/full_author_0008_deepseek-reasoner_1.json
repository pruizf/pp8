The task is to identify the author and the century in which the author lived, and respond with a JSON object in the specified format.\n\nSteps:\n1. Recognize the poem: The poem is \"Carta en Noviembre\" by Miguel S\u00e1nchez-Ostiz.\n2. Author: The poem is written by Miguel S\u00e1nchez-Ostiz. The last two lines of the poem even mention the name: \"mi coraz\u00f3n se queda con Miguel S\u00e1nchez-Ostiz en el Portal de Francia.\"\n3. Century: Miguel S\u00e1nchez-Ostiz is a contemporary Spanish writer. He was born on August 14, 1950. Therefore, he lived in the 20th century and continues to live in the 21st century. However, the question asks for the century in which he lived (using Arabic numerals). Since he was born in 1950, he lived in the 20th century and is still living in the 21st. But typically, when we say the century in which a person lived, we might refer to the century they were born in or the main century of their life. However, the instruction says \"siglo en el que vivi\u00f3\" (century in which he lived). Since he lived (and still lives) in both the 20th and 21st centuries, we must choose the most representative. But note that his birth century is the 20th, and he started his literary career in the 20th century. To be precise, we can note that he was born in the 20th century and has lived in both. However, the requirement is to give one century in Arabic numerals. Since the poem is from the 20th century (it was published in the 20th century) and he is primarily associated with the 20th century, we can put 20. Alternatively, we might consider the century of his birth. But let's check: he was born in 1950, which is the 20th century. He is still alive in the 21st, but the century of his birth and the century when he became known is the 20th. Therefore, we can put 20.\n\nHowever, to be accurate, note that the poem might have been written in the late 20th century. But the exact publication date isn't given, but we know that Miguel S\u00e1nchez-Ostiz was active in the late 20th century.\n\nBut let's confirm: The poem is from his book \"La gran ilusi\u00f3n\" published in 1979. That is in the 20th century.\n\nTherefore:\n- Author: Miguel S\u00e1nchez-Ostiz\n- Century: 20\n\nBut note: the name in the poem is \"Miguel S\u00e1nchez-Ostiz\" (with a hyphen). We should write it exactly as the author's name is known. The standard spelling is \"Miguel S\u00e1nchez-Ostiz\".\n\nNow, the JSON structure:\n{\n  \"author\": \"Miguel S\u00e1nchez-Ostiz\",\n  \"century\": \"20\"\n}\n\nBut wait: the instruction says \"siglo en el que vivi\u00f3, en n\u00fameros ar\u00e1bigos\" meaning we should write the century as a string of Arabic numerals? Or as a number? It says \"en n\u00fameros ar\u00e1bigos\", so we can write it as a string \"20\". However, in JSON, we can have numbers as numbers, but the instruction says to put it in a string? The example format uses quotes, so we'll use a string.\n\nBut note: the example in the instruction is:\n{\n  \"author\": \"nombre y apellidos del autor o autora\"\n  \"century\": \"siglo en el que vivi\u00f3, en n\u00fameros ar\u00e1bigos\"\n}\n\nIt uses quotes, so we should use strings.\n\nTherefore, the response is:\n{\n  \"author\": \"Miguel S\u00e1nchez-Ostiz\",\n  \"century\": \"20\"\n}\n\nBut let me double-check the author. The poem is indeed by Miguel S\u00e1nchez-Ostiz. The mention of his own name in the poem is a self-reference.\n\nSo, final answer."
