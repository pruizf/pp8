        "reasoning_content": "We are given a poem and asked to identify the author. The poem is in Spanish and has a satirical tone. The poem mentions \"Brabo\" and seems to be mocking someone.\n\nLooking at the poem, we see references to:\n- \"Brind\u00f3 Brabo, no el padre, sino el hijo\" (Brabo toasted, not the father, but the son)\n- The poem is a sonnet (soneto) and it is about a failed sonnet.\n- At the end, when asked who the author of such a fatal sonnet is, everyone responds \"Brabo, Brabo\".\n\nThis poem is a well-known satirical sonnet by the Spanish poet Francisco de Quevedo, targeting a contemporary poet named Juan P\u00e9rez de Montalb\u00e1n. The poem is titled \"A un hombre de gran nariz\" (To a man with a big nose) but in this excerpt, it is referring to the incident where Montalb\u00e1n's father (also a poet) and Montalb\u00e1n himself are mocked.\n\nHowever, the author of the poem is Francisco de Quevedo. He lived in the 17th century.\n\nFrancisco de Quevedo y Villegas (1580-1645) was a Spanish nobleman, politician, and writer of the Baroque era. He lived during the 17th century.\n\nSo:\n- Author: Francisco de Quevedo\n- Century: 17 (since he was born in 1580 and died in 1645, so he lived entirely in the 17th century)\n\nNote: The poem is part of Quevedo's satirical works. The reference to \"Brabo\" is a pun on the name of Juan P\u00e9rez de Montalb\u00e1n, whose father was Alonso P\u00e9rez, a bookseller and poet. The son, Juan, was also a poet and was mocked by Quevedo.\n\nTherefore, the response should be:\n{\n  \"author\": \"Francisco de Quevedo\",\n  \"century\": \"17\"\n}\n\nWe note that the poem is by Quevedo and he lived in the 17th century."
