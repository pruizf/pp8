It repeats the word \"fresco\" (fresh) in various forms.\n\n After a quick analysis, the poem is known as \"A una dama que se levant\u00f3 de madrugada\" (To a lady who rose at dawn) and is attributed to the Spanish poet Jos\u00e9 Cadalso (1741-1782).\n\n Jos\u00e9 Cadalso was an 18th-century Spanish writer and military officer. He lived during the 18th century (1700s).\n\n Therefore:\n   author: Jos\u00e9 Cadalso\n   century: 18\n\n But note: the poem might also be attributed to others? However, in standard literary references, this poem is by Cadalso.\n\n Let's confirm the century: Cadalso was born in 1741 and died in 1782, so he lived in the 18th century.\n\n The response must be in JSON format exactly as specified.\n\n Structure:\n {\n   \"author\": \"Jos\u00e9 Cadalso\",\n   \"century\": \"18\"\n }\n\n However, note that the poem is sometimes included in collections of Cadalso's work. There might be a chance of misattribution? But in the context of this problem, we go with the common attribution.\n\n But wait, I recall that this poem is also sometimes attributed to another poet? Let me think again.\n\n Actually, upon second thought, I remember that this poem is often attributed to Jos\u00e9 Cadalso. It is a well-known poem of his.\n\n Therefore, we stick with:\n   author: Jos\u00e9 Cadalso\n   century: 18\n\n But note: the century should be in Arabic numerals as a string? The instruction says: \"siglo en el que vivi\u00f3, en n\u00fameros ar\u00e1bigos\", meaning we write the century as a string of digits.\n\n Example: 18 for the 18th century.\n\n So the JSON will be:\n {\n   \"author\": \"Jos\u00e9 Cadalso\",\n   \"century\": \"18\"\n }\n\n Let's write the JSON accordingly."
