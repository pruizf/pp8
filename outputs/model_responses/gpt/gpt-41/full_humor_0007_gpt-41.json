El tono es ir\u00f3nico: Campuzano empieza siendo un h\u00e1bil espadach\u00edn que rebana narices sin recibir da\u00f1o, pero acaba perdiendo un pie, un ojo y una mano tras sus aventuras en Indias. Sin embargo, la desgracia se relata con ligereza, casi como si fuera una an\u00e9cdota rid\u00edcula. La imagen final tambi\u00e9n resulta humor\u00edstica: un esgrimista famoso reducido a vivir en una ermita, apoyado en un palo, usando un rosario y una ballesta solo para cazar p\u00e1jaros, acompa\u00f1ado de una mujer que le rejuvenece y aparentemente feliz con esos infortunios (\"}  \n \t   \n  \t\t \n \n \n   \n \t\n \n \n   \n  \t \n \n\t\n \t\n \n\n \n  \t\n \n\n \t \n \n \n   \n \t

        "content": "{\n  \"judgement\": \"s\u00ed\",\n  \"reason\": \"El poema es c\u00f3mico porque utiliza el contraste y la iron\u00eda para presentar la historia de Campuzano, un maestro de esgrima inicialmente temido por su destreza (\u201crebanaba narices en Castilla\u201d). Sin embargo, cuando intenta mejorar su fortuna en las Indias, sufre un conjunto de desgracias grotescas y exageradas (queda cojo, tuerto y manco), lo que resulta en una comicidad basada en la acumulaci\u00f3n de infortunios f\u00edsicos. La imagen final, en la que el antes temible espadach\u00edn est\u00e1 reducido a vivir tranquilamente, inv\u00e1lido, acompa\u00f1ado de su mujer y matando pardales con una ballesta, suma a la situaci\u00f3n una dosis de humor absurdo y amable, especialmente reforzada por la moraleja ir\u00f3nica del \u00faltimo verso: \u201c\u00a1Ved c\u00f3mo nacen bienes de los males!\u201d. El poema juega con el contraste entre el pasado glorioso del personaje y su situaci\u00f3n presente, usando hip\u00e9rbole y recursos humor\u00edsticos t\u00edpicos de la literatura burlesca. Por tanto, el tono predominante es humor\u00edstico y el poema puede calificarse de c\u00f3mico.\"\n}",

En primer lugar, recurre a la exageraci\u00f3n y lo absurdo: Campuzano, inicialmente un maestro de esgrima invicto que 'rebanaba narices en Castilla', sufre absurdas y c\u00f3micas desgracias al viajar a las Indias, quedando cojo, tuerto y manco, lo cual resulta en una hip\u00e9rbole casi caricaturesca. Adem\u00e1s, la imagen final del personaje, maltrecho pero resignado, viviendo con su palo, rosario y ballesta para 'matar pardales', a\u00f1ade un toque burlesco y de iron\u00eda, alej\u00e1ndose de la gravedad tr\u00e1gica y acerc\u00e1ndose a la parodia de los viejos soldados. La menci\u00f3n de su Madalena, que le 'quita mil canas', lo presenta en una escena casi dom\u00e9stica y risible por el contraste entre su pasado glorioso y su presente apacible. El remate '\u00a1Ved c\u00f3mo nacen bienes de los males!' funciona como una sentencia ir\u00f3nica que subraya la comicidad de la transformaci\u00f3n del personaje.
