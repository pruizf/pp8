        "reasoning_content": "We are given a poem in Spanish. We need to identify the author and the century they lived in.\n The poem is a sonnet with a humorous and satirical tone, written in a traditional form.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Recognize the poem: The poem is a famous sonnet by Francisco de Quevedo.\n 2. Author: Francisco de Quevedo y Villegas (commonly known as Francisco de Quevedo).\n 3. Century: He lived in the 16th and 17th centuries, but primarily in the 17th century (1600s). Specifically, he was born in 1580 and died in 1645, so he lived in the 17th century.\n\n However, note that the question asks for the century in which the author lived. Since he lived during two centuries, we can note that his most active period and the period in which he wrote most of his works was the 17th century. But to be precise, we can state the century as 17 (for the 1600s).\n\n But let's confirm the poem: \n   - The poem is known as \"Soneto\" or sometimes by its first line: \"Entr\u00e9 a comprar turr\u00f3n, cuando un zapato\".\n   - It is indeed by Francisco de Quevedo.\n\n Therefore:\n   author: \"Francisco de Quevedo\"\n   century: 17\n\n However, the response format requires:\n   {\n     \"author\": \"nombre y apellidos del autor o autora\",\n     \"century\": \"siglo en el que vivi\u00f3, en n\u00fameros ar\u00e1bigos\"\n   }\n\n We should write the author's full name as commonly known: \"Francisco de Quevedo\" or \"Francisco de Quevedo y Villegas\". Since the instruction says \"nombre y apellidos\", we can use \"Francisco de Quevedo y Villegas\", but in many references, he is known as Francisco de Quevedo. Let's use the full name to be safe.\n\n But note: the poem is by Francisco de Quevedo, and he is the only author.\n\n Let's write:\n   author: \"Francisco de Quevedo y Villegas\"\n\n Century: He was born in 1580 (16th century) and died in 1645 (17th century). But the century in which he lived is typically referred to as the 17th century because his adult life and literary career were in the 1600s. However, to be precise, we can say 17.\n\n But note: the question says \"siglo en el que vivi\u00f3\", which can be interpreted as the century in which he spent most of his life. Since he lived 65 years and 45 of them in the 17th century, we can say 17.\n\n Alternatively, we can note that the 17th century is from 1601 to 1700, and he was alive from 1580 to 1645, so he lived in two centuries. But the instruction does not specify how to handle that. Typically, we assign the century of the main part of his life or the century he is associated with. He is a Baroque writer of the 17th century.\n\n Therefore, we will use:\n   century: 17\n\n Final JSON:\n{\n  \"author\": \"Francisco de Quevedo y Villegas\",\n  \"century\": 17\n}\n\n However, note that the century is to be in \"n\u00fameros ar\u00e1bigos\", meaning Arabic numerals (like 17, not XVII). So we write 17.\n\n But wait: the poem might be by someone else? Let me double-check.\n\n There is a possibility of confusion because this sonnet is sometimes attributed to Quevedo, but actually, it is a parody of G\u00f3ngora and is indeed by Quevedo.\n\n Conclusion: We are confident it is by Quevedo.\n\n Let's output the JSON."
