        "reasoning_content": "We are given a poem and asked to identify the author and the century in which they lived.\n The poem is titled \"A un valent\u00f3n\" and begins with:\n   \"Un valent\u00f3n de esp\u00e1tula y greg\u00fcesco\n    que a la muerte mil vidas sacrifica,\n    cansado del oficio de la pica,\n    mas no del ejercicio picaresco,\"\n\n After reading the poem, it is written in a style that is characteristic of the Spanish Golden Age.\n The language and themes (such as a braggart soldier, picaresque elements) are reminiscent of Francisco de Quevedo.\n\n Francisco de Quevedo (1580-1645) was a prominent writer of the Spanish Golden Age, which is the 17th century.\n\n Let's confirm:\n - The poem uses words like \"valent\u00f3n\", \"esp\u00e1tula\", \"greg\u00fcesco\", which are archaic and typical of that period.\n - The structure and rhyme scheme are typical of a sonnet (14 lines, ABBA ABBA CDC DCD).\n\n We know that Quevedo wrote many satirical sonnets, and this one fits his style.\n\n Therefore:\n   author: Francisco de Quevedo\n   century: 17 (because he lived from 1580 to 1645, which spans the late 16th and the 17th century, but his literary activity was mainly in the 17th century)\n\n However, note that the century is the century in which the author lived. Since he lived in the 17th century (1600s), we put 17.\n\n But let's be precise: \n   - He was born in 1580 (16th century) and died in 1645 (17th century). \n   - The century of his life is usually considered the 17th because his active years were in the 1600s.\n\n Alternatively, we can think: the 17th century is from 1601 to 1700. He lived from 1580 to 1645, so he lived in two centuries. However, the problem asks for the century in which he lived. We can say he lived in the 17th century because the majority of his life and his literary production was in that century.\n\n But note: the instruction says \"siglo en el que vivi\u00f3\", meaning the century in which he lived. Since he lived in the 17th century (from 1601 until his death in 1645) and also in the 16th (from 1580 to 1600), we have to choose one? Actually, it's common to refer to the century of his main activity. However, to be safe, we can note that he is classified as a writer of the 17th century.\n\n Alternatively, we can look at the exact requirement: the century in which he lived. Since he lived during the 17th century (even if only part of it) we can put 17. But note: the 16th century is 1501-1600 and the 17th is 1601-1700. He was born in 1580 (16th) and died in 1645 (17th). So he lived in two centuries.\n\n How should we represent it? The problem says \"siglo en el que vivi\u00f3\", which might imply the century of his life. However, in literary contexts, we usually assign the century of the main period of activity. Since his literary career flourished in the 17th century, we put 17.\n\n But let's see if we can find the exact author. I recall that this sonnet is indeed by Francisco de Quevedo. It is Sonnet 516 in his collection.\n\n Therefore, we will respond with:\n   \"author\": \"Francisco de Quevedo\",\n   \"century\": \"17\"\n\n However, note that the century is to be in Arabic numerals and as a string? The example says: \"siglo en el que vivi\u00f3, en n\u00fameros ar\u00e1bigos\". So we write \"17\".\n\n But wait: the example structure is:\n   \"century\": \"siglo en el que vivi\u00f3, en n\u00fameros ar\u00e1bigos\"\n\n So we write the number as a string? Or as a number? The example says \"en n\u00fameros ar\u00e1bigos\", meaning we write the numeral. And in the structure, it is in quotes, so we write it as a string.\n\n However, the instruction says: \"Reply with JSON object ONLY.\"\n\n So we output:\n   {\n     \"author\": \"Francisco de Quevedo\",\n     \"century\": \"17\"\n   }\n\n But note: the author's full name? The problem says \"nombre y apellidos\". So we write \"Francisco de Quevedo\". His full name is Francisco G\u00f3mez de Quevedo y Santib\u00e1\u00f1ez Villegas, but he is commonly known as Francisco de Quevedo. We can use the common form.\n\n Alternatively, to be precise, we can write \"Francisco de Quevedo\". That is the standard way.\n\n Let's confirm: the poem is by Francisco de Quevedo. We are sure.\n\n Therefore, the answer is:"
