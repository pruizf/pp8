  "judgement": "no",
  "reason": "El poema no est치 dise침ado principalmente para provocar risa o diversi칩n, sino m치s bien para expresar nostalgia y making a humorous proposition. While it does contain some witty and humorous lines, such as the offer to trade places with the addressee and give up his 'garbanzo' (a possible euphemism for something valuable) without losing honor, these do not make the poem overall 'comic' in nature. Instead, they contribute to the poem's unique tone, which combines longing for Rome with playful banter. The poem also utilizes formal poetic structures and vocabulary, which are characteristic of serious poetry rather than comic poetry."
